# Vision Module

Real-time phone detection and head-pose attention tracking for StudyWidget.
Runs as a background loop feeding distraction events into `SessionManager`.

Vision is intentionally a lightweight helper subsystem for the main app: it
focuses on capture/detection/calibration and delegates persistence/analytics to
the intelligence layer.

## Key Files

### `camera.py`
Central detection loop. On every frame:
1. **YOLO** (every Nth frame, frame-skipped for speed) detects cell phones via `classes=[67]`.
2. Detections are spatially filtered (guide-box gate when uncalibrated), then appearance-filtered (cosine similarity against few-shot exemplars when calibrated).
3. A high-confidence fallback path preserves visual continuity when few-shot matching rejects all candidates.
4. **`gazeTracker`** updates face/head-pose data and overlays neutral face-presence info.
5. **`_update_distraction_tracking`** logs resolved distractions to `SessionManager`.
6. **`_get_attention_ui_state`** renders a camera-owned 3-state label: `ATTENTIVE`, `LOOK_AWAY`, `LEFT_DESK`.

Cross-package dependency on intelligence is resolved via lazy `importlib` fallback (`src.intelligence...` first, then flat module name), so there is no `sys.path` mutation in `camera.py`.

`camera.py` and `menu.py` keep heavy imports lazy where possible (for example,
calibration classes and OpenCV in menu launch paths) so importing helpers has
minimal startup overhead.

Accepts an optional `session_manager` argument:
```python
from camera import Camera
cam = Camera(session_manager=my_session_manager)
```

### `menu.py`
CLI entry point for the vision subsystem. Options:
- Launch camera loop
- Run phone calibration
- Run gaze center calibration

`menu.py` imports symbols lazily per action. Calibration options do not instantiate or import `Camera` runtime dependencies unless the user actually chooses **Launch camera**.

### `phone_calibration.py`
Multi-phase interactive calibration:
1. **Static phase** — user holds phone still inside guide box; YOLO detections are collected.
2. **Rotation phase** — user rotates phone through several orientations; appearance descriptors are sampled.
3. **Validation** — user accepts or retries the captured set.

Output is saved to `phone_few_shot_bundle.npz` and loaded automatically by `Camera` on next startup.

### `Trackers/attention_tracker.py`
MediaPipe Face Landmarker–based head-pose tracker. Runs at a capped rate (~5 Hz) to avoid overloading the frame loop. Reports:
- `face_facing_screen` — bool
- `attention_state` — `"attentive"` | `"away"` | `"no_face"`
- `yaw_deg`, `pitch_deg`, `roll_deg` — corrected head-pose angles

UI note: the tracker overlay is intentionally neutral (`Face Present: YES/NO`). Final attention messaging is owned by `camera.py` so left-desk transitions are represented consistently.

Week 6 integration hardening:
- small runtime tolerance is applied around calibrated/default bounds so tracking is less brittle across different webcams and seating positions,
- a short no-face grace window smooths transient detector dropouts instead of immediately flipping to `no_face`,
- tracker failures degrade gracefully to cached/default data instead of crashing the camera loop.

### `Trackers/gaze_calibration.py`
Corner-based gaze calibration. Asks the user to look at each screen corner, recording the resulting head-pose bounds. This lets the attention tracker handle off-center camera placement and multi-monitor setups correctly.

## Distraction Logging

`Camera._update_distraction_tracking()` bridges vision into `SessionManager`:

- **Phone distraction** — opens when a phone is first accepted; stays open during a 5-second cooldown so brief flickers don't split one event into many; logs via `log_distraction(PHONE_DISTRACTION, duration)` when the cooldown expires.
- **Look-away distraction** — same cooldown logic using head-pose `face_facing_screen`.
- **Left-desk transition** — no-face intervals start as `LOOK_AWAY`; after 10s continuous absence they are promoted to `LEFT_DESK`.
- **Priority suppression** — phone takes priority only while events overlap in the same frame; phone cooldown does not suppress non-phone tracking.
- **Flush on exit** — `Camera.release()` calls `_flush_open_distractions()` so any event still open when the camera closes is logged using `last_seen` as the end time (not the shutdown timestamp).

Overlay state shown in camera frame: `ATTENTIVE` (green), `LOOK_AWAY` (orange), `LEFT_DESK` (red).

## Running

```bash
# From project root
python -m src.vision.menu

# Or from src/vision/
python menu.py

# Or directly:
python camera.py   # opens detection window directly (no calibration auto-run)
```

Press `q` in the OpenCV window to quit.

## Test Isolation (Vision + Intelligence)

The test setup now isolates test code from functional runtime code while preserving vision ↔ intelligence integration:

- **Pytest-based test suite** — configured in `pyproject.toml` with test paths:
    - `src/vision/tests`
    - `src/intelligence/tests`
- **Shared fixtures in `conftest.py`** create mock camera state and test-specific SessionManager instances.
- **File-based test DBs** are used intentionally and cleaned up after each test run.
- **Import resolution uses project-root-first fallback helpers** (via `importlib`) instead of `sys.path` mutation in vision runtime/tests.
- **Interactive GUI calibration test** is intentionally skipped in automated pytest runs.
- **Direct-run support retained** for debugging (`python .../test_*.py`) with runtime import fallback helpers in test files.

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests from project root
python -m pytest -q

# Run only vision tests
python -m pytest src/vision/tests -v

# Run only intelligence tests
python -m pytest src/intelligence/tests -v
```

These focused helper tests validate the lightweight vision/intelligence seams,
while broader full-suite pytest runs remain the source of truth for complete
integration behavior.

Vision helper tests intentionally cover isolated tracking/calibration logic,
while combined vision + intelligence pytest runs are the recommended integration gate before handing off to other teams.

|------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Foundation | YOLO phone detection + Haar-cascade eye tracking merged into unified `camera.py` |
| 4 | Migration & Calibration | MediaPipe head-pose replaces Haar; interactive phone calibration with few-shot appearance learning shipped |
| 5 | Correctness Sprint | Few-shot phone-validation flow and persisted calibration bundle integrated into camera runtime; distraction event logging with cooldown + priority wired into `SessionManager`; corner-based gaze calibration supports off-center cameras and multi-screen setups; launch/calibration paths cleaned up for integration |

Full sprint notes are in `tasks/Week X/WEEK_X_SUMMARY.md`.
