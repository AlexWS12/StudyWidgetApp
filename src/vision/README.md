# Vision Module

Real-time phone detection and head-pose attention tracking for StudyWidget.
Runs as a background loop feeding distraction events into `SessionManager`.

## Key Files

### `camera.py`
Central detection loop. On every frame:
1. **YOLO** (every Nth frame, frame-skipped for speed) detects cell phones via `classes=[67]`.
2. **Grounding DINO** runs supplementally every 5 frames or immediately when YOLO finds nothing — catches misses at a slightly lower confidence threshold.
3. Candidates are deduplicated via IoU, spatially filtered (guide-box gate when uncalibrated), and appearance-filtered (cosine similarity against few-shot exemplars when calibrated).
4. The winning detection is annotated and passed to **distraction tracking**.
5. **`gazeTracker`** overlays head-pose state (ATTENTIVE / AWAY) on the frame.
6. **`_update_distraction_tracking`** calls `session_manager.log_distraction()` when events resolve.

Accepts an optional `session_manager` argument:
```python
from camera import Camera
cam = Camera(session_manager=my_session_manager)
```

### `menu.py`
CLI entry point for the vision subsystem. Options:
- Launch camera loop
- Run phone calibration
- Run gaze center calibration

### `phone_calibration.py`
Multi-phase interactive calibration:
1. **Static phase** — user holds phone still inside guide box; YOLO detections are collected.
2. **Rotation phase** — user rotates phone through several orientations; appearance descriptors are sampled.
3. **Validation** — user accepts or retries the captured set.

Output is saved to `phone_few_shot_bundle.npz` and loaded automatically by `Camera` on next startup.

### `dino_detector.py`
Wraps `IDEA-Research/grounding-dino-tiny` from HuggingFace. Weights are downloaded on first use and cached. When the package is unavailable the detector silently returns no boxes, so the rest of the pipeline is unaffected.

Typical latency: ~80–200 ms on GPU, ~300–800 ms on CPU.

### `Trackers/attention_tracker.py`
MediaPipe Face Landmarker–based head-pose tracker. Runs at a capped rate (~5 Hz) to avoid overloading the frame loop. Reports:
- `face_facing_screen` — bool
- `attention_state` — `"attentive"` | `"away"` | `"no_face"`
- `yaw_deg`, `pitch_deg`, `roll_deg` — corrected head-pose angles

### `Trackers/gaze_calibration.py`
Corner-based gaze calibration. Asks the user to look at each screen corner, recording the resulting head-pose bounds. This lets the attention tracker handle off-center camera placement and multi-monitor setups correctly.

## Distraction Logging

`Camera._update_distraction_tracking()` bridges vision into `SessionManager`:

- **Phone distraction** — opens when a phone is first accepted; stays open during a 5-second cooldown so brief flickers don't split one event into many; logs via `log_distraction(PHONE_DISTRACTION, duration)` when the cooldown expires.
- **Look-away distraction** — same cooldown logic using head-pose `face_facing_screen`.
- **Priority suppression** — while a phone event is active (including its cooldown window), look-away tracking is suppressed to avoid double-counting the same inattention window under two types.
- **Flush on exit** — `Camera.release()` calls `_flush_open_distractions()` so any event still open when the camera closes is logged using `last_seen` as the end time (not the shutdown timestamp).

## Running

```bash
# From src/vision/
python menu.py

# Or directly:
python camera.py   # runs calibration then opens the detection window
```

Press `q` in the OpenCV window to quit.

## Sprint History

| Week | Focus | Key Outcomes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 3 | Foundation | YOLO phone detection + Haar-cascade eye tracking merged into unified `camera.py` |
| 4 | Migration & Calibration | MediaPipe head-pose replaces Haar; interactive phone calibration with few-shot appearance learning shipped |
| 5 | Correctness Sprint | Grounding DINO added as fallback detector; ByteTrack added for frame-to-frame continuity; distraction event logging with cooldown + priority wired into `SessionManager`; corner-based gaze calibration scoped for off-center cameras and multi-screen setups |

Full sprint notes are in `tasks/Week X/WEEK_X_SUMMARY.md`.
