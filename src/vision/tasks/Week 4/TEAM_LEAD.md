# Team Lead — Architecture, Integration & Management (Jorge)

## Context
This week I'm handling project management, code reviews, and the integration layer that connects vision outputs to the rest of the app. Also responsible for codebase cleanup and making sure both teams have what they need.

---

## Management

### Code Reviews
- [ ] Review Team A's MediaPipe migration PR — verify iris landmarks are correct
- [ ] Review Team A's structured data output — confirm format matches agreed spec
- [ ] Review Team B's parameter experimentation — validate their recommended values
- [ ] Review Team B's structured detection output — confirm format matches spec

### Team Support
- [ ] Ensure `mediapipe` is added to `pyproject.toml` dependencies
- [ ] Answer questions from Team A on MediaPipe landmark indices
- [ ] Answer questions from Team B on YOLO parameter tuning
- [ ] Run both teams' code together and flag any integration issues early

### Planning & Communication
- [ ] Write Week 4 kickoff message in team thread — outline goals and deadlines
- [ ] Mid-week check-in — are both teams on track? Any blockers?
- [ ] End-of-week review — collect findings, write Week 4 summary
- [ ] Start planning Week 5 priorities based on progress

## Codebase Cleanup

### Folder Reorganization
- [ ] Confirm `Trackers/` folder has `__init__.py`
- [ ] Update `vision/__init__.py` — remove outdated TODOs
- [ ] Clean up any `__pycache__/` folders from old structure
- [ ] Verify all imports work after folder renames (`Trackers.iris_tracker`)

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Ensure `pyproject.toml` has `mediapipe` listed
- [ ] Run `uv sync` and confirm clean install
- [ ] Document any version constraints (e.g., mediapipe + Python version compatibility)

## Integration Layer

### Unified Vision Output
- [ ] Design a combined output format that merges Team A + Team B data:
  ```python
  {
      "timestamp": 1741500000.0,
      "attention": {
          "face_present": True,
          "gaze_state": "center",
          "attention_confidence": 0.88,
          "state": "ATTENTIVE"
      },
      "distractions": {
          "phone_detected": True,
          "phone_count": 1,
          "detections": [{"confidence": 0.87, "bbox": (x1, y1, x2, y2)}]
      }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Create `vision_pipeline.py` that orchestrates camera → tracking → detection → output
- [ ] Ensure the pipeline runs at acceptable FPS (target: 15+ FPS)

### Connect Vision to App
- [ ] Define how vision signals reach the UI (`src/experience/mainWindow.py`)
- [ ] Define how vision signals reach the database (`src/intelligence/database.py`)
- [ ] Consider: use Qt signals, callbacks, or an event bus?
- [ ] Prototype the connection — even if just logging events to console for now

### Event System Design
- [ ] Design event types: `PHONE_DETECTED`, `ATTENTION_LOST`, `ATTENTION_REGAINED`, `SESSION_DISTRACTION`
- [ ] Define event payload format (timestamp, type, data)
- [ ] Decide: should events fire in real-time or batch at intervals?
- [ ] Document the event system design for both teams

---

## Hands-On Tasks

### Test Full Pipeline
- [ ] Run `camera.py` with both teams' latest code integrated
- [ ] Test scenario: studying normally → pick up phone → put phone down → look away → look back
- [ ] Verify that the right events/states are produced for each scenario
- [ ] Profile FPS — identify any bottlenecks

### Database Schema
- [ ] Design schema for storing study session data (attention states, distractions, timestamps)
- [ ] Prototype in `src/intelligence/database.py`
- [ ] Decide: SQLite? JSON file? What's simplest for now?

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with current project state
- [ ] Document how to run the app (`uv sync` → `python main.py` or `python src/vision/camera.py`)
- [ ] Add setup instructions for new contributors

---

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Set up basic CI — at minimum, check that imports don't break
- [ ] Create a simple config file for vision parameters (conf thresholds, FPS target, etc.)
- [ ] Prototype a minimal UI widget that shows current attention state (green = focused, red = distracted)

---

## Notes

### My Priorities This Week (in order)
1. Codebase cleanup + dependency management (unblock teams)
2. Code reviews as PRs come in
3. Integration layer design
4. Database schema prototype
5. Stretch goals if time permits

### Key Decisions to Make
- Event system architecture (Qt signals vs callbacks vs event bus)
- Database format (SQLite vs JSON)
- How tightly to couple vision → UI (direct calls vs event-driven)
